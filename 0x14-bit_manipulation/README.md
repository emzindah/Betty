Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
